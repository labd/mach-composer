- Properly implement the `--check` flag on `update` command


## 2.0.2 (2022-04-05)
- Pass environment variables to terraform command


## 2.0.1 (2022-04-05)
- Add aws-cli to the Docker container


## 2.0.0 (2022-04-05)
Rewrite of the Python codebase to Go. Goal is to make it easier to distribute
mach-composer in a cross-platform way.

A number of features which were minimal used are removed.
  - The `mach bootstrap` command is no longer present. It was a simple wrapper
    around Python cookiecutter. This can still be used separately
  - The `mach sites` and `mach components` commands since they were unused.
  - The `--with-sp-login` is removed. This flags used to run `az login`. If this
    is needed it needs to be run before mach-composer is run.
  - The `--ignore-version` flag is removed. The version in the config file now
    indicates a schema version. Only version 1 is supported and updates within
    this schema version should always be backwards compatible.



## 1.2 (2022-04-11)

**general**
- Add `mach init` command
- Skip non-MACH configuration files when processing all yaml files in a directory.<br>
  This allows you to run things like `mach apply` or `mach update` without having to specify the `-f main.yml` option if you only have one valid MACH configuration file in your directory. Fixes #150
- Ignore missing variables when running `mach sites` and `mach components`
- Add `--destroy` flag to the `plan` and `apply` commands
- Add `variables_file` option to the `mach_composer` configuration block to define a variable file
- Show commit author in `mach update` output
- Upgraded commercetools provider to [`0.30.0`](https://github.com/labd/terraform-provider-commercetools/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v0300-2021-08-04)
- Upgraded Amplience provider to [`0.3.7`](https://github.com/labd/terraform-provider-amplience/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v037-2022-03-14)
- Upgraded Azure provider to [`2.99.0`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/blob/main/CHANGELOG-v2.md#2990-march-11-2022)

**AWS**
- Upgraded Terraform AWS provider to [`3.74.1`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#3741-february-7-2022)
- Add support for default tags on provider level
  ```yaml
  aws:
    account_id: 123456789
    region: eu-central-1
    default_tags:
      environment: test
      owner: john
  ```


## 1.1 (2021-11-25)

- Add AWS specific endpoint options;
  - `enable_cdn` creates a CDN in front of an endpoint
  - `throttling_burst_limit` and `throttling_rate_limit` controls throttling on the API gateway

**Azure**

- Upgraded Terraform Azure provider to [`2.86.0`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2860-november-19-2021)
- Add extra Frontdoor frontend_endpoint options:
  - session affinity
  - waf policy support
- Add extra Frontdoor routing options to components such as:
  - Custom routing paths
  - Health probe settings
  - Custom host address and ports
  - Caching options
- Include `frontend_endpoint` in ignore list when `suppress_changes` is used
- Add Frontdoor `ssl_key_vault` option to supply your own SSL certificate for your endpoints
- Add Azure specific endpoint options:
  - `internal_name` Overwrites the frontend endpoint name
  - `waf_policy_id` Defines the Web Application Firewall policy ID for the endpoint
  - `session_affinity_enabled`  Whether to allow session affinity
  - `session_affinity_ttl_seconds` The TTL to use in seconds for session affinity
- Add new `service_plans` option `per_site_scaling`
- Fix: set correct root-level DNS record (`@`) when endpoint URL is the same as the zone

**Commercetools**

- Upgraded Terraform commercetools provider to [`0.25.3`](https://github.com/labd/terraform-provider-commercetools/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0293-2021-06-16)
- Add `tax_categories` to allow more complex tax setups. Does not work in conjunction with `taxes`

### Upgrade notes

**For Azure**

- Each component that has an `endpoint` defined needs to have an Terraform output defined for that endpoint. For example:<br>
  ```terraform
  output "azure_endpoint_main" {
    value = {
      address = azurerm_function_app.main.default_hostname
    }
  }
  ```
  Read more about the [configuration options](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/components/azure.html#defining-outputs).
- Remove endpoints restrictions: Azure components can now use multiple endpoints.
- Changes have been made in the Frontdoor configuration in the underlying Terraform Azure provider.<br>
  If you are using endpoints with a custom domain, you'll need to import the new [`azurerm_frontdoor_custom_https_configuration`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/frontdoor_custom_https_configuration#import) into your Terraform state.<br>
  More on how to work with the Terraform state in [our troubleshooting guide](https://docs.machcomposer.io/topics/development/troubleshooting.html).

### Breaking changes

**Generic**

- **config**: Rename `general_config` to `global`
- **config**: `base_url` has been replaced by the `endpoints` settings:<br>
  ```yaml
  sites:
  - identifier: mach-site-eu
    base_url: https://api.eu-tst.mach-example.net
  ```
  becomes
  ```yaml
  sites:
  - identifier: mach-site-eu
    endpoints:
      main: https://api.eu-tst.mach-example.net
  ```
  When you name the endpoint that replaces `base_url` "main", it will have
  the least effect on your existing Terraform state.<br><br>
  When endpoints are defined on a component, the component needs to define
  endpoint Terraform variables
  ([AWS](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/components/aws.html#with-endpoints)
  and
  [Azure](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/components/azure.html#with-endpoints))
- **config**: commercetools `create_frontend_credentials` is replaced with new `frontend` block:
  ```terraform
  commercetools:
    frontend:
      create_credentials: false
  ```
  default is still `true`
- **config** Default scopes for commercetools frontend API client changed:
    - If you want to maintain previous scope set, define the following in the `frontend` block:
    ```terraform
    commercetools:
      frontend:
        permission_scopes: [manage_my_profile, manage_my_orders, view_states, manage_my_shopping_lists, view_products, manage_my_payments, create_anonymous_token, view_project_settings]
    ```
    - Old scope set didn't include store-specific [`manage_my_profile:project:store`](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/scopes#manage_my_profileprojectkeystorekey) scope. If you're using the old set as described above, MACH will need to re-create the store-specific API clients in order to add the extra scope. For migration options, see next point
    - In case the scope needs to be updated but (production) frontend
      implementations are already using the current API client credentials, a
      way to migrate is to;
      1. Remove the old API client resource with `terraform state rm commercetools_api_client.frontend_credentials`
      2. Repeat step for the store-specific API clients in your Terraform
         state
      3. Perform `mach apply` to create the new API clients with updated
         scope
      4. Your commercetools project will now contain API clients with the
         same name. Once the frontend implementation is migrated, the older one
         can safely be removed.
- **component**: Components with a `commercetools` integration require a new variable `ct_stores`:
  ```terraform
  variable "ct_stores" {
    type = map(object({
      key       = string
      variables = any
      secrets   = any
    }))
    default = {}
  }
  ```
- **component**: The folowing deprecated values in the `var.variables` are removed:
  ```terraform
  var.variables["CT_PROJECT_KEY"]
  var.variables["CT_API_URL"]
  var.variables["CT_AUTH_URL"]
  ```
  See [0.5.0 release notes](#050-2020-11-09)
- **component**: The `var.environment_variables` won't be set by MACH anymore. Use `var.variables` for this


**AWS**

- **config**: The AWS `route53_zone_name` setting has been removed in favour of multiple endpoint support
- **config**: The `deploy_role` setting has been renamed to `deploy_role_name`
- **component**: Introduced new variable `tags`:
  ```terraform
  variable "tags" {
    type        = map(string)
    description = "Tags to be used on resources."
  }
  ```
- **component**: Add `aws_endpoint_*` variable when the `endpoints` configuration option is used. [More information](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/components/aws.html#with-endpoints) on defining and using endpoints in AWS.

**Azure**

- **config**: The `front_door` configuration block has been renamed to `frontdoor`
- **config**: The Azure frontdoor settings `dns_zone` and `ssl_key_*` settings have been removed;<br>
  Certificates are now managed by Frontdoor and dns_zone is auto-detected.
- **config**: The Azure frontdoor settings `resource_group` has been renamed to `dns_resource_group`
- **config**: Moved component `short_name` to new `azure` configuration block
- **state**: The Terraform `azurerm_dns_cname_record` resources have been renamed; they now take the name of the associated endpoint key. For the smoothest transition, rename them in your Terraform state:<br>
  ```bash
  terraform state mv azurerm_dns_cname_record.<project-key> azurerm_dns_cname_record.<endpoint-key>
  ```
- **component**: Prefixed **all** Azure-specific variables with `azure_`
- **component**: The `FRONTDOOR_ID` value is removed from the `var.variables`
  of a component. Replaced with `var.azure_endpoint_*`. [More
  information](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/components/azure.html#with-endpoints)
  on defining and using endpoints in Azure.
- **component**: `app_service_plan_id` has been replaced with
  `azure_app_service_plan` containing both an `id` and `name` so the
  [azurerm_app_service_plan](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/data-sources/app_service_plan)
  data source can be used in a component.<br>

  It will *only be set* when `service_plan` is configured in the component
  [definition](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/syntax/components.html#azure)
  or [site configuration](https://docs.machcomposer.io/reference/syntax/sites.html#azure_1)
  ```terraform
  variable "azure_app_service_plan" {
    type = object({
      id                  = string
      name                = string
      resource_group_name = string
    })
  }
  ```
- **component**: Replaced `resource_group_name` and `resource_group_location` with `azure_resource_group`:
  ```terraform
  variable "azure_resource_group" {
    type = object({
      name     = string
      location = string
    })
  }
  ```

## 0.5.1 (2020-11-10)
- Removed `aws` block in general_config
- Add `branch` option to component definitions to be able to perform a `mach
  update` and stay within a certain branch (during development)


## 0.5.0 (2020-11-09)
- Add new CLI options:
    - `mach components` to list all components
    - `mach sites` to list all sites
- Improved `update` command:
    - Supports updating (or checking for updates) on all components based on their git history
    - This can now also be used to manually update a single component; `mach update my-component v1.0.4`
    - Add `--commit` argument to automatically create a git commit message
- Add new AWS configuration option `route53_zone_name`
- Remove unused `api_gateway` attribute on AWS config
- Remove restriction from `environment` value; can now be any. Fixes #9

### Breaking changes

- Require `ct_api_url` and `ct_auth_url` for components with `commercetools` integration

### Deprecations

In a component, the use of the following variables have been deprecated;

```
var.variables["CT_PROJECT_KEY"]
var.variables["CT_API_URL"]
var.variables["CT_AUTH_URL"]
```

Instead you should use:

```
var.ct_project_key
var.ct_api_url
var.ct_auth_url
```

    version: 81cd828
    is_software_component: false
```

becomes

```
components:
  - name: my-product-types
    source: git::ssh://git@github.com/example/product-types/my-product-types.git
    version: 81cd828
    integrations: ["commercetools"]
