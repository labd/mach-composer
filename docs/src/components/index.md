# Component structure

A MACH component is in it's bare minimum a [*Terraform module*](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html).

Other then the [Terraform configuration](#terraform-component), a component might include a:

- [Serverless function](#serverless-function)

## Deployment process

The deployment of a full-fledged component typically flows through the following steps:

1. Serverless function is built, packaged up and uploaded to a shared resources all environments and sites can access.  
   **Note** at this point, no actual deployment is made; the function doesn't run yet.
2. At the moment the MACH composer deploys a site's Terraform configuration, it uses the component's Terraform configuration to make the necessary modifications to the resources.  
   For example: create the function app instance, necessary routing, etc.
3. MACH composer will use the packages function (from step 1) to deploy the function itself

!!! info "Simple components"
      Not all components need to be a serverless function. A component might be just a set of Terraform instructions to, for example, create a custom product type in commercetools.  
      In that case, step 1 and 3 will be skipped.

Zooming in on the [main diagram](../index.md#how-does-it-work), you'll see the steps illustrated.

## Terraform module

The component must be able to instruct MACH wat resources to create in the cloud infrastructure.
This is done by providing the necessary Terraform module files in the component.


!!! tip ""
      A good practise usually is to place all Terraform files in a single `terraform/` directory and reference that in your MACH configuration.

### Integrations

By defining a set of `integrations` in the [component definitions](../syntax.md#components), MACH knows what variables need to be passed on to the components.

This way the components don't need to define **all possible variables** a component might have.

Available integrations are:

- `aws`
- `azure`
- `commercetools`
- `contentful`

By default, integrations are set on the given cloud provider. So when no `integrations` defintion is given, it defaults to `['aws']` in case of an AWS deployment.

!!! tip "Non-cloud components"
    As an example; you might have a component defining some custom commercetools product types. No further cloud infrastructure is needed.  
    In this case, that component will have `integrations: ['commeretools']` and MACH won't pass any of the cloud-specific variables.

### Required variables

MACH expects each component to have a certain set of variables defined.

Which variables it needs to define (and MACH expects it to accept) depends on the defined [integrations](../syntax.md#components).

#### cloud integration

The following variables are expected in case of either `aws` or `azure`.

```terraform
variable "component_version" {
  type        = string
  description = "Version to deploy"
}

variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Specify what environment it's in (e.g. `test` or `production`)"
}

variable "site" {
  type        = string
  description = "Identifier of the site"
}

variable "variables" {
  type        = map(string)
  description = "Generic way to pass variables to components."
}

variable "secrets" {
  type        = map(string)
  description = "Map of secret values. Can be placed in a key vault."
}

variable "environment_variables" {
  type        = map(string)
  description = "Explicit map of variables that should be put in this function's environment variables."
}

variable "sentry_dsn" {
  type        = string
  default     = ""
  description = "Sentry DSN - only when Sentry is configured"
}
```

!!! info "Cloud specific variables"
      See [AWS variables](./aws.md#terraform-variables) and [Azure variables](./azure.md#terraform-variables) for cloud-specific variables that a component needs in addition to the base set.


#### commercetools

The following variable is given when `commercetools` integration is defined.

```terraform
variable "ct_project_key" {
  type        = string
  description = "commercetools project key"
}

variable "ct_api_url" {
  type        = string
  description = "commercetools API URL"
}

variable "ct_auth_url" {
  type        = string
  description = "commercetools Auth URL"
}
```

#### contentful

The following variable is given when `contentful` integration is defined.

```terraform
variable "contentful_space_id" {
  type        = string
  description = "Contentful Space ID"
}
```

## Serverless function

The component might contain code for a serverless function to run on the cloud provider.

What kind of language/runtime is used for that is irrelevant to MACH. Two things the component needs to contain:

- **Build/deploy script** to build, package and upload the serverless function to a repository
- A **Terraform configuration** for the serverless function

## Cloud provider specifics

A component is always tailored for a specific cloud provider.
