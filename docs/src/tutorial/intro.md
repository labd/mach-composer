# Introduction

## How does it work?

The MACH composer takes a [YAML configuration](../reference/syntax/index.md) as input, and will translate this into a Terraform configuration. It will then execute the terraform configuration, which will deploy all resources for the site architecture.

The MACH composer is intended for managing multiple instances of the architecture.
