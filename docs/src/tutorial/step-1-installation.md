# Step 1. Installation

## Install MACH composer
The easiest way to get started is by installing MACH composer locally to be able
to perform a MACH composer deploy and make use of the
[developer tools](../topics/development/workflow.md).


### MacOS and linux
```bash
brew tap mach-composer/mach-composer
brew install mach-composer
```

### Windows

!!! warning "Windows support is experimental"
    Windows support is experimental and not yet fully tested. We recommend running MACH composer through [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

    Additionally, currently the latest version of MACH composer cannot be installed with Chocolatery. We recommend installing the latest version manually through downloading the [latest available binaries from GitHub](https://github.com/mach-composer/mach-composer-cli/releases/latest).

```ps
choco install mach-composer
```

### Alternatives
You can always download the latest release via the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/mach-composer/mach-composer-cli/releases)


## Install Terraform
Make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine.

On macOS and Linux we recommend using [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv)
to easily switch between Terraform versions when needed.

1. Install [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv): Follow the instructions on [https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv)
2. Make sure you have Terraform installed
   ```bash
   $ tfenv install latest
   ```

For Windows, you can install it via chocolatey.

```ps
choco install terraform
```
