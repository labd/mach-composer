# Step 1. Installation

The easiest way to get started is by installing the MACH composer locally to be able to perform a MACH deploy.

```bash
pipx install mach-composer
```

[More information](./workflow/environment.md#installing-the-cli) about installation.


## Next steps

Before you can deploy a MACH stack, you have to;

1. Setup the basics in your cloud provider, and
2. Create a commercetools project

Instructions can be found in the [prerequisites section](./prerequisites/index.md).

!!! tip
    Keep your created component repository information at hand for later: you'll need it when creating a new component.

    This means; the resource group, storage account and container name in Azure or the AWS S3 bucket name.
