# Azure deployments

## Resource groups

MACH will create a **[resource group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/resource_group) per site**.

!!! info ""
    Only when a [`resource_group`](../../../reference/syntax/sites.md#azure) is explicitly set, it won't be managed by MACH.

## HTTP routing

Only when a MACH stack contains components that have an [`endpoint`](../../../reference/syntax/components.md) defined, MACH will setup a **Frontdoor instance** to be able to route traffic to that component.

### Default endpoint

If you have defined your component with a `default` endpoint, MACH will create a Frontdoor instance for you which includes the default Azure domain.

```yaml
components:
  - name: payment
    source: git::ssh://git@github.com/your-project/components/payment-component.git//terraform
    endpoints:
      public: default
    version: ....
```

!!! note ""
    This `default` endpoint doesn't need to be defined in your [endpoints definition](../../../reference/syntax/sites.md#endpoints).

### Custom endpoint

Whenever a custom endpoint from your [endpoints definition](../../../reference/syntax/sites.md#endpoints) is used, MACH will require that you have configured [`frontdoor`](../../../reference/syntax/global.md#frontdoor) for additional DNS information that it needs to setup your Frontdoor instance.

In addition to that it will also setup the necessary DNS record.

### Component routing

For each component with an `endpoint` MACH composer will add a route to the Frontdoor instance using the name of the component.

So when having the following components defined:

```yaml
components:
  - name: payment
    source: git::ssh://git@github.com/your-project/components/payment-component.git//terraform
    endpoints: 
      public: main
    version: ....
  - name: api-extensions
    source: git::ssh://git@github.com/your-project/components/api-extensions-component.git//terraform
    version: ....
  - name: graphql
    source: git::ssh://git@github.com/your-project/components/graphql-component.git//terraform
    endpoints: 
      public: main
    version: ....
```

The routing in Frontdoor that will be created:

![Frontdoor routes](../../../_img/azure/frontdoor_routes.png)

!!! tip "Frontdoor resource"
    An important thing to keep in mind is that the [Frontdoor resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/frontdoor) in Terraform is managed as a single resource, including all the routing to the components.

    This means the components can't create the routing themselves (as with AWS) but need to instruct MACH how to set up routing. This can be done by defining routing options in [output values](../../../reference/components/azure.md#defining-outputs).

## App service plans

MACH can create an [App service plan](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/app_service_plan) that can be used for any MACH component that uses the `service_plan` configuration option (either in the [component definition](../../../reference/syntax/components.md#azure) or the [site-specific configuration](../../../reference/syntax/sites.md#azure_1)).

What kind and how many service plans it will create depends on what service plans are needed by the components, and how the [`service_plans`](../../../reference/syntax/global.md#service_plans) configuration looks like.

By default, MACH will create a `default` service plan which is a Consumption plan, if any of the components have `service_plan: default` set in their configuration.

In this case, you don't need to define the service plan yourself, MACH automatically creates this default for you:

```yaml
service_plans:
  default:
    kind: "FunctionApp"
    tier: "Dynamic"
    size: "Y1"
```

## Action groups

When an [Alert group](../../../reference/syntax/sites.md#alert_group) is configured, an [Action group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/monitor_action_group) will be created.

Components can use that action group to attach alert rules to.
