# Amplience

When configured, MACH can manage a [hub](https://amplience.com/docs/intro/hubsandrepositories.html) per site.

For this you need to define a **client_id** and **client_secret** in your [general config](../syntax/general_config.md#amplience).

## site configuration

Each site can have their own Amplience configuration and but needs a hub id.

You can define the id of the hub your [site configuration](../syntax/sites.md#amplience) by giving it a **hub_id**.
