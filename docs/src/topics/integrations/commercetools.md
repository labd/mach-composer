# commercetools

## Configuration

From a MACH configuration file, you can configure the following items in commercetools:

- currencies
- languages
- countries
- channels
- taxes
- stores

For more information about these configuration options, see the [syntax](../syntax/sites.md#commercetools).

!!! tip "More fine-grained control"
    MACH provides a couple of basic configuration options which in most cases are sufficient and is setup very quickly.<br>
    If you need more control over the configuration in your project, you can load custom configuration through a new component which would include the necessary Terraform configuration for that.<br>
    For example a `commercetools-setup-component`.

## API client management

MACH is provided by admin credentials which allows MACH to fully manage your commercetools project.

Each component that implements functionality that needs to communicate with commercetools needs their own set of credentials.
The component is responsible for creating the necessary API client credentials for that specific component, with only the most necessary scopes set.

One way a component could facilitate in this would be to define the following in your Terraform config:

```terraform
locals {
  ct_scopes = formatlist("%s:%s", [
    "manage_orders",
  ], var.ct_project_key)
}

resource "commercetools_api_client" "client" {
  name  = format("%s_api_extension", var.name_prefix)
  scope = local.ct_scopes
}
```

## Stores

MACH provides built-in [commercetools Stores](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/stores) support.

It's possible to

- Configure your stores within a MACH configuration (see [example](#example-configuration-block) below)
- Define store-specific variables and secrets per component

For example, when two stores are defined `uk-store` and `nl-store`, these can be used to configure your component:

```yaml
component:
  - my-component:
    variables:
      FROM_EMAIL: mach@example.com
    store_variables:
      uk-store:
        FROM_EMAIL: mach@example.co.uk
      nl-store:
        FROM_EMAIL: mach@example.nl
    store_secrets:
      uk-store:
        MAIL_API_KEY: 5kg6Z4HxgLMfBjYj5BOg
      nl-store:
        MAIL_API_KEY: i1hajIJ92LPNYGB2p3W1
```

The component can use the correct variables based on the context that is decided based on incoming requests or other information available.

!!! warning "Using store-aware context in components"
    Although MACH composer provides a data structure for managing your configuration in different contexts, it is the responsibility of the component itself to parse this data structure correctly, and apply the right configuration in the right context.

    <!--TODO: add link to example implementation where we parse and apply the store-aware configuration in a component.-->
