# Encrypt MACH configuration

A MACH configuration typically contains secrets that are configured on the components as well as secrets used to configure the integrations.

We recommend using [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops) to encrypt your MACH configuration files or a part of it.

## Using SOPS
#### Encrypting

Encrypting your file can be done with the `sops --encrypt` command:

=== "AWS"
    ```bash
    $ export SOPS_KMS_ARN="arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:927034868273:key/fe86dd69-4132-404c-ab86-4269956b4500"
    $ sops -e --encrypted-regex '^(.*(secret|token).*)$' main.yml > main.enc.yml
    $ mv main.enc.yml main.yml
    ```
=== "Azure"
    ```bash
    $ export SOPS_AZURE_KEYVAULT_URLS="https://yoursharedsops.vault.azure.net/keys/sops-key/<your-key>"
    $ sops -e --encrypted-regex '^(.*(secret|token).*)$' main.yml > main.enc.yml
    $ mv main.enc.yml main.yml
    ```

#### Decrypt during deployment

MACH composer offers built-in support for decrypting sops-encrypted files automatically.

When MACH composer encounters an encrypted YAML file, it will attempt to decrypt the file prior to the execution of `generate`, `plan` or `apply`. 
Make sure that your CI/CD environment has access to the appropriate encryption keys in AWS KMS or Azure KeyVault.

##### Decrypting manually
Manual decrypting of the configuration can be done as follows:

```bash
$ sops -d main.yml --output-type=yaml > main.yml.dec
```

And you can then execute MACH composer with this decrypted file:
```bash
$ mach apply -f main.yml.dec
```

## Encrypted variables

Just as you would encrypt your MACH configuration, it is also possible to use an encrypted variable file to be used in your configuration.

For example, if you would run MACH with 

```bash
mach apply -f main.yml --var-file variables.yml
``` 

and `variables.yml` is encrpyted with SOPS, MACH will use [terraform-sops](https://github.com/carlpett/terraform-provider-sops) to make sure the encrypted variables are used in a secure manner.
